# example-adaptable-aggrid

This is a very small sample application that uses AdapTable.

It is designed to allow you to build very small demos for Support purposes.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `yarn`), depending on what tool you're using.

## Running in Development Mode

Execute the following command

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

NOTE: The first time you run this, it takes longer as parcel generates some cache, etc - subsequent runs will be a lot faster

Now navigate to [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in order the see AdapTable in action.

Any change you make in your sources will trigger a browser reload, since parceljs comes with built-in hot-reloading in order to keep you productive.

## Building for Production

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This generates a `dist` folder, which you can deploy on a webserver.

On your local machine, you can run

```sh
$ npx serve dist
```

to launch a webserver that serves the generated `dist` folder - now go to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to see the production version.

## Licences

A licence for AdapTable provides access to all product features as well as quarterly updates and enhancements through the lifetime of the licence, comprehensive support, and access to all 3rd party libraries.
